#### Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This project entailed the creation of a C++ class to model the operation
of a clock.  The clock class provides the ability to increment the time,
and to display a 12 or 24 hour representation of the time.

#### What did you do particularly well?

The functionality of the clock in this project met all of the specified requirements.  
This was done with code that is readable and maintainable.

#### Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

The Clock object also contains the user interface code in this artifact.  An enhancement would be
to refactor the user interface into a separate class, and have the Clock class only model the core clock functionality.

#### Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

The logic to add hours and minutes had several corner cases, which required iterative testing.   In the future,
I would develop unit tests for these corner cases before writing the code.

#### What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

Creating abstractions the are modeled well with classes is relevant to many projects, especially user interface code.

#### How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I followed best practices for formatting, variable naming, and other standards set by the course.  Additionally,
I used comments wherever the intent of the code was not obvious.
